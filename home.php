            Dolefil Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Cooperative (DARBC), one of the largest cooperatives in the Philippines, became the owner of 8,860 hectares of National Development Corporation lands in Polomolok South Cotabato. It was created through the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) in 1988 under the administration of President Cory Aquino. Members of DARBCI were all regular rank and file employees of Dolefil when CARP was enacted. All DARBC members are entitled to rental shares of the land leased by Dole Philippines Inc. and remain beneficiaries even when they are retired or retrenched from the company. DARBCI building is located within the Complex Cannery Site.
